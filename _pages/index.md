For the past several years graph databases have been one of the fastest growing types of databases on the market.  However with any new technology the journey to using this technology can be fraught with many wrong turns. The fundamental driving factors for this site are to empower you to leverage graph databases as a tool to build applications. Beginning in 2018, Dave Bechberger and Josh Perryman began writing a book specifically to teach the lessons they learned about building applications using graph databases to a wider audience.  These teachings would go on to become ["Graph Databases in Action"](https://www.manning.com/books/graph-databases-in-action?a_aid=bechberger) by Manning Publications.  


However even though the book has been published, there was a large amount of material that didn't make the cut, for a number of different reasons.  This site is dedicated to providing those resources out to the community at large.  It is meant to provided a vendor agnostic way to learn about the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of working with graph databases.  We hope to teach these lessons through content including articles and blog posts.  

Remember this is meant to be a community resource and we would love to get contributions from others, after all this is meant as a community resource.  Being a git repository it is as simple as clone, modify, and PR to get your thoughts and opinions heard.
