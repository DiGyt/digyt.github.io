I'm a Master's student in Cognitive Science. I want to understand how the brain works
(at least a little bit) and to translate this understanding into formal systems.
This aim requires not only the study of the brain and other complex dynamical systems,
but also studying the methods we use to gain insights about them: Data processing, 
statistics, and machine learning.

I hope that with this blog, I can share some of my code snippets with other people 
and in some way or another support them on their own journey of understanding the brain.

I also love programming, especially in Python. Most of my code is provided in the form 
of IPython notebooks which can be run directly in Google Colab. I chose this way 
because I think that it gives people very direct access to playing around with Python 
code, without the need to install complicated libraries.
